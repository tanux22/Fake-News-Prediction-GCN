        "2.  **Model**:\n",
        "    *   **GAT (Graph Attention Networks)** often outperforms GCN because it can learn *which* neighbors are important. In fake news, not all tweets or related articles are equally important. GAT's attention mechanism assigns weights to neighbors, filtering out noise.\n",
